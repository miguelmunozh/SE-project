# GUI

This repository contains an app.py file which handles which html files are shown in the specified urls, and the templates folder with html files for each page/window of the web application. 

The templates folder also contains a layout.html file which contains a main layout that will be displayed in all of the html files extending layout.html. This is done in order to avoid code repetition.
