# FRIC

## brief description of the project

The purpose of the Findings and Reporting Information Console (FRIC) is to assist the 
U.S. Cyber Experimentation & Analysis Division team (CEAD) in distributing and managing 
work with documentation of cyber engagements amongst analysts. FRIC shall help create, 
read, update, and delete events, systems of systems, tasks, and sub-tasks pertaining to 
the cyber engagement from where the lead analyst will be able to assign tasks to other 
CEAD analysts. FRIC will aid documenting confirmed vulnerabilities, findings, and 
mitigations with the choice of attaching images and files. Once all information is 
gathered from an event, analysts shall be able to generate a Risk Matrix, Final Report,
